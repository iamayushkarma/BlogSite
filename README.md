## 🧰 Appwrite Setup (Required)

To run this project, you'll need to set up your own Appwrite backend:

- 🆓 **Create a free Appwrite account** at [https://appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io) and start a new project.
- ⚙️ **Enable the required APIs**:
  - 🔐 Auth
  - 🗄️ Database
  - ☁️ Storage
- 🗃️ **Create a Database** and note its `Database ID`.
- 📁 **Create a Collection** inside the database (e.g., `"Posts"`) with necessary attributes like `title`, `content`, etc., and note the `Collection ID`.
- 🖼️ **Create a Storage Bucket** for image uploads and note its `Bucket ID`.
- 🆔 **Get your Project ID** and **API Endpoint** from your Appwrite project settings.
- 📝 **Update your `.env` file** in the root of your project with these values:
